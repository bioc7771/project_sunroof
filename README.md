# Rooftop-Assessment-for-solar-power-using-Satellite-Imagery
Extracted the dataset of houses from Satellite images and analysed each house rooftop's solar power potential

AI-based technology to assess your Rooftop Solar potential

Individual rooftops of each and every house are identified and segmented out. If you really think that's an easy task, go have a look at the image quality and resolution of rooftop in Google Maps. India doesn't even have a 3D map. Project Sunroof would be very easy in India if we just have 3D map by Google or any map service provider like MapMyIndia, Open Street maps, etc.In US, the Google Map has a clear view at 26/27 zoom level whereas in India you can zoom upto only 22 zoom level. The image quality at 22 zoom level is so bad that you can't even figure outby yourself where the boundaries of each house lies. 

# Aerial Rooftop Detection Methods
# 1) Hough Transform: 
It is used to localize shapes of different types of rooftops. When applied to the image, it gives very less true positives. The main problem was to set threshold parameter of Hough Transform. Windowed Hough Transform: Used to detect exact shapes like squares and rectangles. The main limitation of this method was that it wonâ€™t work for other structures if not perfectly
square or a rectangle present in the image.
# 2) Adaptive Canny Edge: 
Applying auto canny on the low-quality image of rooftop results in exact edge detection of rooftops.
Contour Area localization and then applied threshold to detect rooftop. It was also a failure.
# 3) Watershed Segmentation: 
Segmentation on the images from maps to count the number of buildings and to plot rooftop area of each building present in the image. It failed in the case of the densely populated area.
