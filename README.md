# Rooftop-Assessment-for-solar-power-using-Satellite-Imagery
Extracted the dataset of houses from Satellite images and analysed each house rooftop's solar power potential

AI-based technology to assess your Rooftop Solar potential

Individual rooftops of each and every house are identified and segmented out. If you really think that's an easy task, go have a look at the image quality and resolution of rooftop in Google Maps. India doesn't even have a 3D map. Project Sunroof would be very easy in India if we just have 3D map by Google or any map service provider like MapMyIndia, Open Street maps, etc.
